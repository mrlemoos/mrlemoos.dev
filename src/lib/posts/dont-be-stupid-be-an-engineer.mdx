Every so often, someone pops up to announce that "learning to code is pointless now" because AI can do it for you now. Right. Also, let's stop learning how to cook because Uber Eats and Doordash exist.

It might sound weird coming from someone who works at a company that sells AI adoption as an accelerator; but the problem with statements like that is they ignore a fundamental difference between _software development_ and _software engineering_. And if, in your mind, they are the same, congrats-- you've just identified your first problem.

## Software development vs. software engineering

**Software development** is writing code to make it work. It's the "first draft" of the feature/product that you might throw out or tweak later. It's tactical. It's the "work on my machine" time.

Meanwhile, **software engineering** is designing systems that *keep* working even under load, under change, and under the inevitable chaos of real-world users (we know they can find bugs the best QAs on this Earth wouldn't). It's about architecture, scalability, maintainability, and deciding on trade-offs that won't come back to haunt you in your sleep six months from now.

## Why we need more engineers (and fewer keyboard heroes)

The industry is overflowing with people who can "get something working" but can't explain why it works (looking at you who copy/paste code from Stack Overflow and shout "it works" without the faintest idea what's happening under the hood.) We don't need more of those.

We need critical thinkers, long-term code designers, and people who understand the trade-offs of their decisions. For all of above, the "it compiles" should never be the end goal, but a means.

And here's the reality check: **AI is not replacing engineers any time soon.** What it _is_ replacing, or at the very least, automating, is the repetitive, boilerplate-heavy part of development; the one that I look at in Cursor and say, "Shoot, I don't want to do this now."

If you're an engineer, AI coding tools are like, as a good friend of mine puts it, "a really smart junior developer" on your team. One who works at the speed of light, never sleeps (looking at you fancy [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with background agents), and doesn't complain about Jira tickets. But here's a catch, and let's see if you can guess it --

**They're still juniors**.

Being a junior isn't bad, but it's not the end goal. The end goal is to be **good at what you do** and provide value. And to be good, you need to architect and engineer things before typing `cursor .` in your terminal.

AI can misunderstand requirements, may not have the full context, it won't know about the obscure rule a lead mentioned they've done five years ago with the words, "Well, it's a long story, but...". AI can produce brilliant work, but they also make mistakes, occasionally generate something that seems fine until it explodes in production and you get that heartwarming phone call at 3 in the morning.

If you're just a developer who ships whatever the autocomplete suggests without understanding it... Well, AI will eat your lunch, your dinner, your scones, and your job.

## AI as a driver for change (and a mediocrity filter)

AI is a **filter**. But not the one you spend your time on IG playing with. It's the kind of filter that draws a line between "good" and "bad," between the people who comprehend and design systems from the people who just type things into a text editor.

In large organisations, and living through startup-to-enterprise transition (which might be most of my experience), AI adoption will 1) speed up delivery if you know how to use it, 2) improve quality if you know to apply the right constraints to it, 3) reduce costs if you know how to automate tasks that make your burden heavier.

It can be the your best mate. But only if you know how to do it, and the people around you know that how they can leverage it, but specially know what they CAN'T do with it.

An engineer will certainly use AI to generate scaffolding, refine things for performance, security, and maintainability. An engineer will explore multiple architectural approaches before typing `git commit`. An engineer will automate tedious refactoring.

However, a developer will ask AI "write code for X, Y, Z" and ship it without reading it. A developer will introduce three security vulnerabilities and a memory leak in a snap. A developer will wonder why the system falls over in production or how these odd data came in because he committed secrets without knowing because their AI copilot recommended it to them.

Everything with maturing comes with--

## A mindset shift (stop being a keyboard hero)

The best leaders in the industry whom I've had the pleasure to meet/work with have something in common: they utter the importance of **not having heroes**. They understand that having a team of heroes means constantly putting out fires; heroes put out fires, and if they are putting out fires all the time, they won't design, prepare, and architect.

> It's not about the code. It's about the thought process that leads to the code.

Surviving in a new landscape in the era of AI requires stopping thinking of yourself as "someone who writes code," and start thinking of yourself as "someone who solves problems by engineering things." And guess what, coding is just a part of the process.

By engineering solutions first, I mean:
  - Understanding trade-offs, problems.
  - Mapping out potential solutions, risks, and benefits.
  - Knowing _when_ to think about performance.
  - Thinking about security, scalability, and maintainability.
  - Using AI as a tool, not a crutch. If you got to know the tech industry before AI, and you weren't a good engineer back then, AI won't turn you into a rockstar.

**AI won't fix your broken architecture.**

**AI won't fix your broken process.**

**AI won't save you from yourself.**

In a world where AI can write code, the value engineers bring is not typing, but **thinking**, and manifesting it. We can foresee problems. We can make decisions AI can't make for you. We can build systems that work not just today, but for years to come.

And no, I don't own the truth. This is my take, shaped by years of building, breaking, fixing, and building again. 

You can call me names, you can disagree-- but if you do, show me your reasons.

That's what engineers do.
