I don't track you, I just want to know how many people read my blog posts.

Those were the words on my mind last night. I wanted to see if I was writing something that people really read, or if I was just talking to myself.

I can be a dev, an engineer, front end, full stack-- but at the end of the day, I'm a storyteller more than any of those things. And the stories I want to tell are the ones that I'm passionate about.

**Problem is...**

I don't know if people are reading what I write.

Not even when I was so deep in the rabbit hole of office politics, I had this feeling that I was just talking to myself.

And all of that because I don't know which analytics tool to use. Or at least, I _did_ not know.

## The Initial Solution

As someone who imagines code fairly easily, I thought: "How hard can it be to implement a Redis-based analytics system?"

I'm not even kidding. I thought: "I'll just use Redis. It's easy. I'll just use the Vercel Redis integration and... _poof_".

Well, it turns out that it's not that easy.

Even [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) does facilitate a bit of the bottlenecks when it comes to the number of requests per minute,
I didn't want to have to deal with the hassle of writing a Redis client and maybe creating a route in Next.js to handle the analytics.

...So I dropped this idea even before it could see the light of day.

## (Maybe) a Better Solution?

One solution would be to use a third-party analytics tool like [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) or [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).

But come on, both PostHog and Google Analytics are... well, too much for a simple blog. I'm not looking for leads or creating a tunnel through which I can track my users and convert prospects.

## Enter Vercel Analytics

I've been using Vercel for a while now, and I have received a few emails about the Vercel Analytics tool.

But I always ignored.

Why? Because Vercel sells a product, and I'm kind of sceptical about people selling products. For those of you who use Vercel, did you know there's an "Analytics" tab in the dashboard? Yeah, there is. I thought so much that that was a premium feature for paying customers that I never even bothered to click it-- yeah, _to click it_.

And when, after 4 hours, and one ridiculous attempt of self-hosting a [Plausible community edition](http://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics).
(_Yeah, I'm not kidding. I'm not even kidding._ I did try that.)

I finally decided to give it a shot and click on that bloody "Analytics" tab.

And I'm glad I did.

You wanna see the best part?

It's free-_ish_.

I mean, I can look at the number of views on my blog posts, bounce rate, location (country/city), and browser in the last 30 days.

And that's more than enough for me.

**Lesson of the day:** Don't be afraid to do the easy thing (and click the bloody tab!)
