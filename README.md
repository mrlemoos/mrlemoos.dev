Hi there, üëã

This small project is built to be my portfolio with a bit of my experience and
realizations. Also, it is a repository to share my articles, projects, and
stacks and tell you how I used a few technologies.

This project is created with [React](https://react.dev),
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

The homepage is inspired by the [Spotlight](https://spotlight.tailwind.com)
template from the TailwindLabs team, despite liking the original so much, I
wanted to change it a bit and here's the result.

If you'd like to support their amazing work, please don't hesitate to take a
look at the [TailwindUI templates](https://tailwindui.com/templates)
marketplace, which is fabulous.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) by Vercel | _The React Framework_.
- [React](https://react.dev) | _The library for web and native user interfaces_.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) | The anti-hero of UI components libraries
    (_my words, not theirs_).
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) | _Rapidly build modern websites
    without ever leaving your HTML_.
- [Contentful](https://contentful.com) | _Contentful is the platform where you
    can update the content of your website, a mobile app or any other platform
    that displays content_.

## Running the project

**Step 1.** To run this project, you must have a project created on Contentful with the
following content type(s):

- **Blog Post** (content type name: `blogPost`) with the following fields:
    `title`, `description`, `content`, `slug`, `tags`, and `createdAt`.

**Step 2**. In the `.env` file, you'll fill the `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` and
`CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables.

> ‚úçÔ∏è Note: If your `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` starts with the `-` (hyphen)
  character, wrap the whole token in quotes "". Otherwise, Next.js won't
  recognise it as a string.

**Step 3.** Install the dependencies and development dependencies. _I'm using
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io) here, but if you'd like to use another package manager
such as [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), just
use their installation commands.

```sh
pnpm install # or pnpm i
```

**Step 4.** Start up the development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev # or pnpm dev
```
